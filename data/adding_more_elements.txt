To add additional elements, a number of things need to be done:

1. Make an entry for the element and all relevant ions of the element in 
src/ElementNames.hpp. Start by adding a HAS_ELEMENT define in the 
appropriate place at the top of the file, and then work your way down. 
Make sure not to touch the position of the counters in the enums!
